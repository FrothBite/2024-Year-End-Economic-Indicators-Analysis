# 2024-Year-End-Economic-Indicators-Analysis
Calculate the change of indices, stocks, and economic indicators.

The purpose of this project is to calculate and document the performance and changes of indices, stock (singular), and economic indicators I found to be the most interesting for recapping 2024.
Data sources are the Federal Reserve, Yahoo Finance, and technically Finviz (though no Finviz-related code was written and is absent from the project).
